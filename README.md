# SmartRoot to R-SWMS

## Overall

These project aims a creating a small program that can efficiently transform SmartRoot data into a R-SWMS RootSys file.
The RootSys file can then be used to run simulation in R-SWMS with an experimentaly generated root system.

## Specification

- Java (for the script)
- SQL database (for data storage)
- SmartRoot (http://www.uclouvain.be/en-smartroot)
- ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html)
